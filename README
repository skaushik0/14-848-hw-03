This repository contains the source for 14-848: HW-03 (NoSQL) homework.
The script, "script.py" is used to upload the sample data file which is
located in "data/aws/moviedata.zip"), unzips it and uploads it to an S3
bucket. The unzipped file, which has a JSON document of the movie data
is parsed and inserted as records into a DynamoDB table, which will be
queried from.

The JSON file has data in the following format:

    [
       {
          "year" : ... ,
          "title" : ... ,
          "info" : { ... }
       },
       {
          "year" : ...,
          "title" : ...,
          "info" : { ... }
       },

        ...

    ]

The query is to return all the movies that are in the table for a particular
year. For instance, 1993 gives:

    inf: db_query: 'KeyConditionExpression=Key('year').eq(1993)'
     - Dazed and Confused                                              1993
     - Hocus Pocus                                                     1993
     - Jurassic Park                                                   1993
     - Schindler's List                                                1993
FILES

    - script.py
      Uploads data to an S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table and queries for it.

    - Makefile
      Helper scripts to run "script.py" and clean-up the resources created
      by it.

    - data/{ins/aws}
      Sample data files; ins/* has files from the assignment handout,
      while aws/* has sample movie data. The script uses the latter.
      The structure of the JSON file is described above.

    - images/*
      Screenshots from the terminal running queries for the uploaded data.
